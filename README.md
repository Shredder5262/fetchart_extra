# fetchart_extra

A beets
 plugin that extends the built-in fetchart to download extra album artwork: discart (CD art), back covers, and spines.

âœ¨ Features

Fetches artwork from multiple sources:

Fanart.tv

TheAudioDB

MusicBrainz Cover Art Archive

Checks the filesystem first before downloading.

Handles multi-disc albums (discart1.png, discart2.png, â€¦).

Normalizes output to PNG.

Automatic post-processing:

Removes white disc backgrounds using ImageMagick.

Resizes to configurable dimensions:

discart â†’ 1000Ã—1000

back â†’ 750Ã—750

spine â†’ 35Ã—700

Configurable fuzz tolerance for background removal.

Resilient networking: skips gracefully on timeouts or SSL issues.

Verbose logs: shows which source provided each artwork.

ðŸ“¦ Installation

Copy fetchart_extra.py into your beetsplug directory (e.g. /config/beetsplug/).

Enable it in your beets config under plugins.

Configure API keys (Fanart.tv and TheAudioDB).

Run beet fetchart_extra or let it run automatically during imports.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

MusicBrainz does not provide spine art. Only Fanart.tv and TheAudioDB do.

All artwork is saved in PNG format regardless of source.

Multi-disc albums create discart1.png, discart2.png, etc.

If a source API fails, the plugin skips gracefully and tries the next.
